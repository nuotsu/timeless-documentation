The _Header_ section is a global section displayed on all pages that is used to display the logo, navigation, and some core functionalities of the site including search, account actions and a link to the cart.

The _Header_ is sticky and will always be visible at the top of the page, but does have some customization options such as a color scheme, spacing offsets and cart display options.

## Mega Menus

Particular parent-level menu items can be made a "mega menu," or an expanded dropdown that displays nested menus in a multi-column layout. To do so, add a **Mega menu** block and set the text to the exact text of the parent-level menu item.

## Featured Links

Particular nested menu items under mega menus can be made a "featured link" with an image. To do so, add a **Featured Link** block and set the text to the exact text of the parent-level menu item. Depending on the link, the theme will attempt to display a matching image. This can be easily overwritten by uploading an image in the block settings.
