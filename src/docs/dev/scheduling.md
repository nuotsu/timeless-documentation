title: Scheduling
---

A number of sections in _Timeless_ include the ability to "schedule" or display content during a specific time period. This is useful for content like promotions, events, and other time-sensitive information.

## Usage

Compatible sections will have blocks with scheduling options: **Start datetime** and **End datetime**. Enter the desired datetime in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format and the content will display between those two times.
