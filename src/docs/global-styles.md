## Color Schemes

You'll find yourself setting text and background colors in multiple sections across your store. To make this easier, _Timeless_ utilizes [colors schemes](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/themes/theme-structure/color-scheme). Most sections have the option to choose from a list of color schemes you define in the theme settings.

_Timeless_'s color scheme properties include:

| Name | Usage |
| :-- | :-- |
| `canvas` | background color |
| `ink` | text color |
| `stroke` | border color |
| `canvas-subdued` | subdued state background color |
| `ink-subdued` | subdued state text color |
| `primary` | primary accent color |
| `primary-contrasting` | primary accent text color |
| `secondary` | secondary accent color |
| `secondary-contrasting` | secondary accent text color |
