## What is the Timeless Theme?

*Timeless* is a Shopify Theme (Online Store 2.0) built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, and is built for both merchants and developers.

## For Merchants

Like all other themes, *Timeless* comes with a number of core templates and sections to build your store with.

Unlike most other themes, *Timeless* utilizes a number of advanced and newest features of Shopify, like [product filters]() and [color schemes](), to have granual control over your store's look and feel and provide a better shopping experience for your customers.

Additional key features of *Timeless* include:
- [90+/100 Lighthouse performance scores]()
- semantic HTML markup for better SEO
- marketing-focused sections and components, such as:
	- [scheduled announcements]()
	- [scheduled promo hero sections]()
	- [customizable call-to-actions]()

... and much more.

## For Developers

Like all other themes, *Timeless* comes with all core functionality required for a Shopify Store (obviously).

Unlike most other themes, *Timeless* is a developer-friendly repo using [Tailwind CSS]() for styling and minimal JavaScript for functionality, making it a breeze to maintain and scale.

Additional key features of *Timeless* include:
- empty `/assets` directory â€” No JS, CSS, images, fonts ... nothing!
- a native CSS approach (`.carousel`) or [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) for carousel and slider components
- [`icon.liquid` snippet]() for easy SVG icon rendering

... and much more.
